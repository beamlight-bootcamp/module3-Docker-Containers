# Making containers publicly Available

In this lesson we wil learn how we can make our containers publicly available

If we want to examine run command of a particular image we could always find details
regarding that in the dockerhub. Let's say we want to see which port we can run nginx
container on, we can see this information by going to the following link

https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx

The format is usually https://hub.docker.com/_/ followed by the image name

Let's say we want to see similar information for jenkins container we can find that info by
going to

https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins

Recommendation is to always use the docker official image
